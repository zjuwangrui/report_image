Linear fit result:
Fit equation: f = 2.232054 * v + -156.240127
Since we expect f = -kv:
k = -2.232054 (drag coefficient)
Correlation coefficient r = 0.781125
R squared r^2 = 0.610157
Standard error = 0.892070

Theoretical analysis:
According to the model f = -kv:
Drag coefficient k = -2.232054 dyne·s/cm
This means that for every 1 cm/s increase in velocity, the drag increases by -2.232054 dyne

Validation of fit quality:
fair: (r² < 0.8)
